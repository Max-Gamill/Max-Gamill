## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Max, a 3rd Year PhD student at the University of Sheffield in the [Pyne Lab](https://pyne-lab.uk/) where I help uncover the role of DNA shape in self- and protein interactions through automated image analysis pipelines. I studied Physics at the University of Leeds during my undergraduate and Masters degree where I was introduced to Python and developed a love for scripting, coding and now software development.

## Current Interests
- ðŸ”­ **I'm currently working on:** image analysis workflows for atomic force microscopy images of DNA using [TopoStats](https://github.com/AFM-SPM/TopoStats/):

- ðŸŒ± **I'm currently learning about:** image-based deep-learning models and how auto-encoders could help with shape analysis via transfer learning (private repo until publishing):

### Additional Projects:
- Created from scratch an interactive portfolio website showcasing early work such as; a simple feed-forward neural network to classify hand-drawn numbers trained on the MNIST dataset, a susceptible, recovered and infected (SIR) disease model, and monte-carlo simulations to model the magnetic moments of a 1D spin Ising model.
  - A key challenge here was to create a frontend which could take client-side variables (and even drawing canvases!) and send these to the appropriate python scripts to be processed on the Raspberry Pi server.
  - The project used: a html, css and javascript frontend, a Django and AJAX backend, hosted on a Ubuntu Raspberry Pi, equipped with an Apache gateway and port forwarding. (The webserver is currently down to free up the Raspberry Pi for other projects). Source code available at: ...

- (In progress) Creating from scratch an marketplace for personalised artwork / photo editing using a variety of algorithms and machine learning models (no generative models!). Once complete I hope that people would be able to apply funky filters to their own images and personalise them for cards / invitations such as those below:
